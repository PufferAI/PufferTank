# Puffer Cluster

Usage is subject to the Puffer Cluster User Agreement. You must have signed this to use the cluster.

This is a shared cluster. Run htop/nvidia-smi before running your own jobs, push your changes to your fork, etc. Build stuff and don't be stupid

Don't fuck with the base system. You are booted into a container by default. If you get out of it by mistake, source ~/.bashrc or bash puffertank/docker.sh test.
